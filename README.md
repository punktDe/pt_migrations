## Installation

1. Install the extension as usual in TYPO3 

2. Copy the file `Configuration.sample.yaml` to `config/Configuration.yaml` where config is on the same level as your document root.

3. Double check that `migrations_directory` contains valid relative paths from the document root to your folders which contain the migrations.
